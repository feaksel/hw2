Well this is a simple KNN implementation for a homework from my university class ELE489 - Fundamentals of Machine Learning.

I basically prepared the data from my homework then I Implemented a simple knn that I mostly got from Internet. Finally I plotted a graph and implemented a simple confusion matrix printer and classification report.

I used python 3.9.0 Kernel for my codes and notebooks.
